    <p>Will you dare to confront The Thing? <em>The Thing I Don&rsquo;t Want to Think About</em> takes you on an adventure through three levels of a mysterious arcade machine. You&rsquo;re guided by your imaginary friend, a teddy bear named Frinchfry, in search of a mysterious shadowy creature.</p>
    <p>Team Comma Door produced this first-person narrative adventure game for the Spring 2015 3D capstone course. I worked on general gameplay programming and environmental art creation. I also developed the retro CRT screen shader that is present in various places throughout the game.<p>
    <p>Along with me, our team included Bri Evans, Xilu Fang, Katie Park, Micah Scott, and Ronald Yam. <a href="http://confrontthething.com">Check out the game&rsquo;s website for more information and to play the game!</a></p>

    <p>Team Potato Lab developed this environmental puzzle game for the Fall 2014 2D capstone course. The team included Katie Park, Cindy To, Aaron Villalpando, Ronald Yam, and yours truly. Ronald Yam and I created the character animations for the game&mdash;I rigged the character while he animated it. <a href="https://colorlessgame.wordpress.com/">Visit our website for more info and to play the game.</a></p>

      To make our character&rsquo;s cloth animate seamlessly, we created a MEL script for Maya that loops nCloth simulations.
